      <h1>welcome</h1>
      <p>
      Hi there. My name is Chiayo and this is my site.
      I'm a student studying computing at the University of Maryland,
      College Park. Shoot me an email if you'd like to talk. You can
      reach me via my email address <i>cyl at umd dot edu</i> (PGP key:
      <a href="https://chiayolin.org/key.txt">bbca c9bd 0a1c 61ad</a>).
      </p>
      <h2>find . -type l</h2>
      <p>
      You can find me on
      <a href="https://github.com/chiayolin">GitHub</a> as well as 
      <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/chiayolin">Linkedin</a>, where
      you can find my resume. That said, if you're not on LinkedIn, but
      still would like a copy of my resume (thanks), email me, let me
      know who you are, and I'll send you a copy.
      </p>
